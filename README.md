* `library(ggplot2)`
* `library(Hmisc)`
* `library(ggm)`
* `library(dplyr)`
* `library(corrplot)`
* `library(pastecs)`
* `library(readxl)`
* `library(scales)`

* `library(data.table)`
* `library(QuantPsyc)`
* `library(car)`

You can install any of those (if you don't have them) with `install.packages(PACKAGE_NAME)`.
